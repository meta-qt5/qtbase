7de3744 Add linux-oe-g++ platform
  too OE specific, probably cannot be upstreamed
eef6d0d qlibraryinfo: allow to set qt.conf from the outside using the environment
  again very OE specific to read everything from environment (reusing the same
  qmake from sstate and replacing all configured paths in it with qt.conf from
  environment).
6ada901 Add -external-hostbindir option
  is a lot better for upstreaming (and it was already sort of approved by
  Oswald) but in 5.2.0 I've noticed that he added something similar for
  android builds
e306b72 configureapp: Prefix default LIBDIRS and INCDIRS with SYSROOT
  again a bit OE specific
b4de3b2 qt_module: Fix pkgconfig replacement
  prevents cross-compile unsafe -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib paths etc
0af204f configure: don't export SYSTEM_VARIABLES to .qmake.vars
  specific to linux-oe-g++
02b1405 configure.prf: Allow to add extra arguments to make
  OE specific for EXTRA_OEMAKE
cb64125 configure: make pulseaudio, alsa, freetype a configurable option
  upstreamable
f6140ec cmake: Use OE_QMAKE_PATH_EXTERNAL_HOST_BINS to determine path to host binaries
  Required for -external-hostbindir usage from CMake
4b1d4a8 qmake is already built in qtbase-native
  OE specific for native/target builds
57e63c2 Allow building a separate qmake for the target
  OE specific for native/target builds
bf81316 qtbase: allow build of examples
  OE configuration
f326fd2 QOpenGLPaintDevice sub-area support
  added functionality
7bfffed Revert "Set PRIVATE includes variable to empty, not undefined."
  trying to fix empty Qt5*_PRIVATE_INCLUDE_DIRS variables for CMake, e.g.
  cmake/Qt5Quick/Qt5QuickConfig.cmake with 5.2.0:
    set(Qt5Quick_PRIVATE_INCLUDE_DIRS "")
  with 5.0.2:
    set(Qt5Quick_PRIVATE_INCLUDE_DIRS
        "${_qt5Quick_install_prefix}/include/qt5/QtQuick/${Qt5Quick_VERSION_STRING}"
        "${_qt5Quick_install_prefix}/include/qt5/QtQuick/${Qt5Quick_VERSION_STRING}/QtQuick"
    )
